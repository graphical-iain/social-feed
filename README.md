#Info on my Fork

- Fixed the callback.
    - Default callback is for the feed to fade in after all have been loaded.

- Updated the Facebook module to support v2 of the Facebook Graph API.

- I removed support for Google+, VK, Blogspot because I didn't need them.
    - I can add this back in if anyone wants it.
